# Transfer Learning and DL Models 
The repository contains many state of the art transfer learning models, that can used directly for DL applications without need for heavy computational systems. 

The Models Include:

1. VGG16
2. RESNET34
3. SQUEEZENET
4. INCEPTIONV3
5. GOOGLENET2
6. ALEXNET
7. 6-Layered CNN
8. CNN
9. LRCN 

# Numpy Based Neural Network 
 ## The notebook contains a 2 layered neural Network designed from scratch using only NUMPY Library. 
 ### Function Include:

 1. init_params()
 Initializes all the weights and biases. 
 2. ReLU()
 The activation function to add non-linearity.
 3. forward_prop()
 The process of forward propagation.
 4. ReLU_deriv()
 Derivative of activation, required for back propagation. 
 5. backward_prop()
 The process of backward propagation.
 6. update_params()
 Update all wights and biases with new values.
